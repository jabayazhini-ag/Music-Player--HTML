            Harris&apos;s musical journey began early, influenced by his father, S. M. Jayakumar, a noted film
            guitarist. He
            started formal training in Carnatic music at the age of six and later honed his piano skills at the Trinity
            College of Music, London. Before becoming a composer, he worked as a session musician, arranger, and
            programmer, notably under A. R. Rahman. Known for his meticulous attention to sound engineering and mixing,
            Harris often collaborates with top sound engineers. His disciplined work ethic is reflected in the long
            hours he spends perfecting each track.

            collaborations and music for global events further highlight his versatility. Beyond his musical

            appearances outside his professional commitments. His profound influence on the music industry, innovative
            compositions, and dedication to his craft have cemented his legacy as one of the leading composers in Indian
